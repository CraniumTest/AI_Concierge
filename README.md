# README for AI Concierge Implementation

## Introduction

The AI Concierge project is an AI-powered virtual assistant specifically designed for the hospitality industry, aimed at enhancing guest experiences in hotels and resorts. This implementation provides a basic framework that leverages large language models to interact with guests, personalize responses, and simulate integration with hotel management systems.

## Project Structure

- **`main.py`**: Acts as the entry point of the application, handling user interactions and integrating various components.
- **`language_processor.py`**: Utilizes a language model to process text inputs from the user, currently demonstrated with basic sentiment analysis.
- **`user_preferences.py`**: Manages guest preferences to tailor responses, providing a foundation for personalized experiences.
- **`hotel_system_interface.py`**: Simulates interactions with hotel systems for operations like room booking.
- **`local_insights.py`**: Provides simulated local attractions and restaurant recommendations to the guests.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists required Python packages, particularly the Transformers library by Hugging Face for language processing.

## Features

1. **User Interaction**: Allows simple text-based communication between the AI and users. Users can engage with the system to receive assistance during their stay.

2. **Language Processing**: Implements a basic language processing capability using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model. This can be expanded to process various guest queries.

3. **Preference Management**: Provides a mock-up for adjusting responses based on user preferences, pivotal for a personalized guest experience.

4. **Simulated Hotel System Integration**: Demonstrates how the application might interact with hotel reservation systems through a basic room booking simulation.

5. **Local Insights**: Offers guests information about local attractions and dining options as part of its concierge service.
